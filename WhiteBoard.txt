Pierre's Bakery
Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.
All functionality for the models should be tested.

I will create each class complete with its auto-implemented properties
BREAD
The user will specifiy the amount of bread they want (5). Since every third bread is free, i will use a foreach
loop that finds every number leading up to that number that is a multiple of 3 and remove it from 
an array of all numbers leading up to it. I will then multiply the length of the array by 5.

PASTRY 
The user will specifiy the amount of pastries they want (5). Since every third pastry is discounted 
by a dollar, I will use a loop and every time the count is a multiple of three i will subtract 1$
from the price.


I will test each of these classes seperately starting with their most basic functionality.
