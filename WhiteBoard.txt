Pierre's Bakery
Create a C# console application for a bakery that includes the following functionality:

There should be two classes: one for Bread and one for Pastry.

When the user runs the application, they should receive a prompt with a welcome message along with the cost for both Bread and Pastry.

A user should be able to specify how many loaves of Bread and how many Pastrys they'd like.

The application will return the total cost of the order.

Pierre offers the following deals:

Bread: Buy 2, get 1 free. A single loaf costs $5.
Pastry: Buy 1 for \$2 or 3 for $5.
All functionality for the models should be tested.

I will create each class complete with its auto-implemented properties
The user will specifiy the amount of bread they want (3). Since every other bread is free, if the amount
  ordered is even i will simply cut the price in half. If the amount ordered is odd I will subtract
  one from the counter, divide in half, then add 5$
  
  
BREAD will have a counter and method and each time it is % 2 == 0 the price will not increase since any even number will mean 
  they are using the buy 2 get one free deal.
PASTRY will have a counter & method where each time it is % 3 == 0 the price will only increase by one since any multiple of 3 will mean
  they are using the buy three for 5$ deal
I will test each of these classes seperately starting with their most basic functionality.
